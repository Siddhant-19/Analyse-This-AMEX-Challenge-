# Analyse-This-AMEX-Challenge-2019

Credit card fraudulent risk prediction challenge conducted by American Express in Top 7 IITs.

Model and Algorithm Description:
1. Applied Random forest model for classification
2. Applied Logistic Regression along with Hyperparameter Tuning 
3. Used the GridSearchCV technique for parameter tuning
4. Since the dataset was highly skewed, used robust fit to reduce the skewness before training the model.
5. Before training the model, also performed Data Prepocessing to clean the data.
